## Project

**YTraderHarnessFE** — YTrader Harness 的前端控制台（Umi Max v4 · antd v6 · ProComponents v3 · antd-style）。
由 Ant Design Pro 模板改造而来；模板自带的演示页面、假数据与 mock 服务已清空，现在的每个页面都对接真实后端
（默认 `http://localhost:8080`，dev 由 `config/proxy.ts` 转发 `/api/`）。

## Commands

`npm start` (dev+mock), `npm run dev` (no mock), `npm run build` (utoopack), `npm run lint` (Biome+tsc), `npm run test` (Vitest), `npx antd lint ./src` (antd-specific checks).

Other: `npm run biome` (auto-fix), `npm run tsc` (type-check only), `npm run preview` (build + serve on :8000).

## Critical Rules

- **接口一律写在页面同目录的 `service.ts`** — 不再使用 openapi 代码生成（模板的假 spec 已删）
- **Biome only** — no ESLint, no Prettier. Both `npm run lint` and `npx antd lint ./src` must pass before commit
- **Always `npx antd info <Component>` before writing antd code** — don't guess APIs from memory
- **Conventional commits** required (commitlint enforced)
- **TypeScript strict** · **Node ≥ 22** · **`package-lock.json`** (not yarn/pnpm)
- **`.umi` dir is auto-generated** — delete `src/.umi` and restart if dev server acts up

## Architecture Essentials

**Config**: `config/config.ts` (defineConfig), `config/routes.ts` (declarative routes). Route `name` → `menu.xxx` i18n key; `access` field gates visibility.

**Convention files** (`src/`): `app.tsx` (runtime config + `getInitialState`), `access.ts` (permissions), `global.tsx` (side effects), `loading.tsx`, `typings.d.ts`.

**Auth**: Casdoor OAuth（`src/services/auth`）。`/api/v1/auth/login` 拿授权地址 + state cookie → 跳 Casdoor → `/user/callback` 换 access token；没有本地账号体系，也没有密码表单。

**State**: `useModel('filename')` for global hooks (`src/models/`). `useModel('@@initialState')` for currentUser/settings. ProTable `request` prop for most data loading. `@tanstack/react-query` for complex server state.

**Styling priority**: Tailwind CSS v4 (layout) → antd-style v4 / `createStyles` (theme tokens) → CSS Modules → Less (legacy only).

**Request**: built-in `request` from `@umijs/max`, configured in `src/requestErrorConfig.ts`. Per-page `service.ts` for non-generated APIs.

**i18n**: 8 locales in `src/locales/`. `useIntl().formatMessage({ id, defaultMessage })`.

**Mock**: 页面级假数据放同目录 `mockData.ts`（**不要叫 `_mock.ts`** —— 会被 umi 当 Express handler 加载）。`config/config.ts` 的 `mock.include` 只扫 `src/pages/**/_mock.ts`。

**Cloudflare Worker**: `cloudflare-worker/` — separate Hono app, own `package.json`, not an npm workspace.

## AI Skills

This project ships with two built-in Claude Code Skills (`.claude/skills/`). If you already have these skills in your project, no installation is needed — just run them directly. To update to the latest skill definitions, run `npx skills add ant-design/ant-design-pro`.

### `/pro-upgrade` — Project Upgrade

Run `/pro-upgrade` in Claude Code to auto-upgrade the project to the latest Ant Design Pro version. It diffs the latest template against this project and merges framework changes while preserving business code. Works for any version gap (v5→v6, v6.x→latest, etc.).

### `/antd` — Ant Design CLI

Run `/antd` in Claude Code for any antd-related work. It provides access to `@ant-design/cli` with offline metadata for antd v3/v4/v5/v6. Key commands:

- `npx antd info <Component>` — look up props/API before writing code (mandatory)
- `npx antd lint ./src` — check for deprecated or problematic usage (must pass before commit)
- `npx antd demo <Component> <demo>` — get working code examples
- `npx antd migrate <from> <to>` — migration checklist between major versions

## Page Co-location

Each page dir: `index.tsx`, optional `service.ts`, `_mock.ts`, `data.d.ts`, style files. Keep page-specific code with the page.

# CLAUDE.md

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
